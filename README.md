Must be between 20 and 80 characters. If the subtitle has fewer than 20 characters, trailing white spaces are added.

### `description`

## Secrets

You have to configure your secrets at: Settings >> Secrets

- ` ${{ secrets.KAGGLE_USERNAME }}` - **Required** The dataset owner.
- ` ${{ secrets.KAGGLE_KEY }}` - **Required** The API key for your user. You can [create your api key here.](https://www.kaggle.com/account)   

## Examples usage

Create a main.yml file like this in the path your repo, in the path `.github/workflows/main.yml`

Change the fields in that yaml : id, files, title, subtitle and description.
Add the secrets.

Please consider that if you are NOT creating a new dataset, only updating it, the following fields are not used, so you can skip it :
 - title
 - subtitle
 - description
 - is_public

## Example

### Example1 : Create a new dataset, uploading a file, "titanic.csv"
```yaml

name: upload

# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
# events but only for the master branch
on:
  push:
    branches: [ master ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ master ]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  upload:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      # Runs a single command using the runners shell
      - name: Upload datasets
        uses: jaimevalero/push-kaggle-dataset@v2 # This is the action
        env:
          # Do not leak your credentials.
          KAGGLE_USERNAME: ${{ secrets.KAGGLE_USERNAME }}
          KAGGLE_KEY: ${{ secrets.KAGGLE_KEY }}

        with:
          id:  "jaimevalero/my-new-dataset"
          title: "Testing github actions for upload datasets"
          subtitle: "Titanic data2"
          description: "## Example of dataset syncronized by github actions <br/>Source https://github.com/jaimevalero/test-actions and https://github.com/jaimevalero/push-kaggle-dataset <br/> "
          files:  titanic.csv
          is_public: true

```

### Example2 : Upload more than one file

You can use:
 - wildcards (eg: *.xlsx )
 - directory names (eg: images )

If you use directory names, you will upload every file from that directory.
Please bear in mind that files in subdirectories are packaged in tar file, due to API behaviour.

In case you use more than one line, you should use the "|" operator.

```yaml
          files: |
            titanic.csv
            *.xlsx
            images
```

### Hint: Skip workflow based on commit message

You can configure your workflow itself.
En this example, the workflow only triggers when a string is found in the commit message

```yaml
  upload:
   if: "contains(github.event.commits[0].message, 'madrid_results.csv')"
```

Complete yaml for these examples could be find at examples directory
